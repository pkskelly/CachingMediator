# CachingMediator
Sample project to learn how to use [MediatR](https://github.com/jbogard/MediatR) Pipeline (behaviors) for validation, caching, and logging.  

This project is my project for learning the use of MediatR Pipeline patterns.  Thanks to  [Mukesh Murugan](https://github.com/iammukeshm) and [Adam Anderly](https://github.com/anderly).  While I reviewed the following articles, the project was created from the ground up and I had to make some modifications to resolve all warnings.
